Hello! Welcome to my Portfolio Page.

This blog is an attempt at three things:
- First: Compile all the interesting work I've done for future employers and graduate programs
- Second: Have a place to put up some cool climbing and outdoor pictures from my adventures
- Third: Learn `jekyll`!
    
Projects ranging from AI Tetris, Java Graphics Applets, and Climbing to be posted soon! Stay tuned...
