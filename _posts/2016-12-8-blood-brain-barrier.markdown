For my senior project at Colorado College I tried to create a neural network that could predict the blood-brain permeability of any chemical compound. This project came out of a talk given by Professor Michael Pollastri (Northeastern) about African sleeping sickness drug discovery.

This project gave me the ability to combine various computer science algorithms to real world problems and gave me a chance to dive into the low-level details of an algorithm implementation.



If youâ€™re interested in an in-depth technical write-up of my genetic algorithm combined with neural network approach to predict the blood-brain permeability of chemical compounds look [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/predicting_blood_brain_barrier_permeability.pdf).

The code can be found [here](https://github.com/LodewijkBrand/bbb_capstone).
